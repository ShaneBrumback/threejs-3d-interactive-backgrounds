## Introduction
In this article, we will explore how to create an interactive 3D background using the powerful Three.js library. We'll dive into the code and understand how it enhances a website by adding dynamic lighting effects and animated elements.

## Overview
The code provided showcases a captivating scene built with Three.js. Let's break it down and understand its different components and functionalities.

## Setting up the Scene
The code begins by setting up the necessary components for our 3D scene. It initializes the scene, camera, and renderer using the Three.js library. The renderer is configured to provide antialiasing and an alpha channel for transparency. The renderer's output is appended to the document body, allowing it to be displayed on the webpage.

## Lighting the Scene
Lighting plays a crucial role in creating a visually appealing 3D scene. The code adds various types of lights to the scene to enhance the visual experience. An ambient light provides general illumination, while a directional light casts a strong light source from a specific direction. Additionally, point lights of different colors are positioned at specific coordinates to add vibrant highlights to the scene.

## Adding Textures
The scene incorporates a smoke texture to give the background a captivating and dynamic appearance. The smoke texture is loaded using the TextureLoader class from Three.js, and it is applied to multiple planes in the scene. These planes act as surfaces on which the smoke texture is mapped.

## Animating the Scene
The scene comes alive with animations. The code includes an animation loop that updates the scene on each frame. It rotates the planes around their own axes, creating an illusion of movement. The position of the point lights is also animated using trigonometric functions, resulting in dynamic changes in their coordinates.

## Interactive Elements
The point lights, specifically the orange and blue lights, are programmed to move across the scene. By incrementing their positions in each frame, they create an engaging and interactive experience for the user.

## Responsive Design
The code accounts for responsive design by resizing the camera and renderer when the window is resized. This ensures that the 3D scene adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across devices.

## Conclusion
By leveraging the power of Three.js, we have created an immersive and visually stunning 3D background for our website. The combination of lighting effects, animated elements, and interactive features adds depth and interactivity to the webpage, enhancing the overall user experience. Experimenting with different textures, lighting setups, and animations can unlock a world of possibilities for creating captivating 3D scenes using Three.js.
